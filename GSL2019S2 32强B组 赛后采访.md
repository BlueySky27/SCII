### GSL2019S2 32强B组 赛后采访

Impact

Alright, we'll meet Impact, who has become much more placid with his gameplay. I think you made a very smooth run today, how do you feel about finishing first in your group?

I knew I was gonna finish first if I can beat Zest, however in the winners match, it was Trust, so if I were to lose that game, I don't think I would pass out of my group today, so I am relieved to the fact that I made through as winner of this group.

You are consistently smiling when the screen captured you, what kind of thoughts were you having?

Besides the first game in the winners match, all the other matches went as what I predicted, so that was great.

(Not translated.)

I don't think I am not on the good form right now, so as I advance to the upper round, I think I can do much better.

You are able to get a payback against Trust, who beat you earlier in the qualifiers for GSL, as well as you also beat Zest in a very dominating fashion, how was that like in the first set in Cyber Forest?

I'm not really sure that I'm that dominant versus Zest, especially when he is the highest rated player as a Protoss on the ladder right now, however all of his plays were very predictable to me, I think that was the driving force for my victory today.

You made such an easy run to the second group stage, you fell short last season to Maru, and were you able to find some answers for you ZvT?

I am very confident at both my ZvT and ZvP, and compared to my mirror matchup, I like ZvT and ZvP much better, so I prefer those two over the mirror match.

What do you think about Maru being eliminated in the round of 32?

I don't have that much emotion to it, and I never gave that much thought, but I realized once again that GSL can be a stage where some of the top tier players can also be eliminated in a very early stage.

Last words to your fans and your expectations for this tournament?

I think I advance with ease today, I am very satisfied to myself for my improvements, and I hope I can get enough support from my future rounds, thank you.



GuMiho

Alright, following the super tournament, can we expect a lot from GuMiho, who's the runner of this group and made to the round of 16?

Thank you.

That was a very tense decider's match, how do you feel about your victory?

Initially when I lost 0 to 2 in a very dominant fashion, so I thought I wasn't going to make out of the group tonight, however I'm relieved that I did, and I'll make sure that I'm going to adjust my units to evade more of the psionic storms.

You didn't fall twice to the same opponent, what were some of the thoughts you had in order to overcome Trust.

I tried to finish the game before the psionic storm is completed, because I wasn't able to scatter my units very well. And because due to the lack of my micro control the game actually went very hard because my overall game plan was to finish it before add-up timing.

Instead of following the upgrade from the double forge based Protoss, you tried to make a a lot of timing-based attacks, which really didn't work out on New Repugnancy, what are your commence about it?

When I fought at the ramp I really screw up big time. It's very hard for Terrans to catch up with the upgrades for 22 because Protoss's upgrades are already done by then. I think the biggest factor of my losses due to my lack of proper point of control.

So using the 11 timing attack is the best against the double-forged based Protoss before they hit the 22 upgrades?

That's how usually you drain out the menace of the sentry and high templars, and the you keep pressing the Protoss and that's the winning equations, however my micro just didn't live up to my standards, so I couldn't do it. On the final set, I was able to pick up my opponent in an all-in build and win.

Well eventually you made it, it may be regrettable due to your loss in the finals of the super tournament. how do you feel about it?

Objectively I've been keeping thinking that finishing first one off is a very good feat, however emotionally it's not an easy task to maintain that. My PvT kind of got shaky since then, so I thought I was going to get knocked out, I had the possibility to get knocked out, especially when I saw Maru get knocked out last night. So for this season I want to go as high as possible, hopefully win the whole thing.

You receive a lot of players' cons and mockeries, and then form group of death all the time, what were your plans this season?

Besides group A every other group has always been very arduous in every season of GSL, so in that regards it doesn't really matter whom I pick, but I'll try to pick as an affordable opponent as possible.

Any last words to your fans?

I'll make sure that I do really well this season and hopefully make it to the Blizzcon, so thank for your support.
