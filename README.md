# StarCraft II Post-Match Interviews 

This repository contains the post-match interviews of StarCraft II tournaments in English and Chinese, the former recorded from the oral interpretation in the VODs of the tournaments like GSL and WCS on their official stream on YouTube, the latter translated from the English records, all conducted by my own.

Trying to catch up with the matches, but finding it quite difficult, still working hard.

The English records may have a lot of mistakes for I mainly focused on the Chinese translations.

I also push the interviews in Chinese to my account at bilibili.com, this repository is used for an online storage and provide my English records, which are open to correction.

Thanks for reading.
