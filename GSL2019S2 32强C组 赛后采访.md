### GSL2019S2 32强C组 赛后采访

Classic

Alright, there was no upset in group C, he show the class of tier-1 player, we have the winner of the group C, Classic, congratulations!

Thank you.

As a tier-1 player, you were able to pass through the group as the first place, how do you feel?

Our group has two Zergs, so if I were to be caught off guard, then I would probably lose out of this group, however I'm very content to the fact that I finish first in the group.

I think you've being consistently maintaining the form from the super tournament, and due to your desperation you were able to lift up the super tournament trophy, how do you feel back then?

It was great but I really yearn to win a championship in the GSL. So in spite of winning the super tournament, I really want to win GSL S2 as well.

You keep making consecutive runs to the finals, are you physically or mentally worn out?

It's indeed tiresome, however I believe it's a blessing to attend a lot of tournament as much as possible, especially when I don't have that much opportunity left in my take anymore.

This season, Maru's being eliminated, and followed by a lot of low-tiers players making to the second group stage, what did you think about the current atmosphere about GSL?

For last year's semifinals and the season 1's final in the past, I always lost to Maru. However, I was very happy to the fact that he's being eliminated in the round of 32. And because I never got the top-seed opportunity, so now that I made it to the round of 16, and I have the top-seed opportunity, I'll look forward some great opportunities in the later rounds as well.

We're expecting a lot of you as a top-seed player in the group nomination, and we're also expecting how you're going to use the power as a top-seed player. How you're gonna exactly use it?

I'm just gonna focus as much as possible for my group. In the past I've being teased by a lot of players so I really want to seek revenge to the players who gave me a hard time during the past group nominations, including Dark, Patience and so on. I think it's going to be a fun group nomination.

I think we saw that nothing has changed in terms of your passion into GSL S2. any last words to the fans?

I really gonna do my best and win the title home. Thank you.



Hurricane

All right, here is our runner-up of group C, who has completely altered his style. Hurricane, congratulations!

Thank you!

You became a victor tonight, how do you feel right now? You seem very poignant.

I prepared well, and I know I lack little bit of skills in PvP, so I prepared that as well. Once I hit the winner's match I was gonna go directly advance from the group, however, things didn't go as planned, so I crawled my way out back into the round of 16.

I was very curious how you feel when you defeat a nemesis, which is Solar whom you have never beaten in LotV, who was also your former teammate. You were able to take down such a nemesis, how do you feel?

I think he got too comfortable facing versus me, and he always has this Hurricane mind that he will always stop me whenever he encounters me. So I think that kind also allowed me to push through and take a win today.

You seem like completely altered your style, you were very proficient with your all-in attacks. Previously you were more of a macro player, however you seemed to be much more blinded with the both of all-in and micro waves plays.

I think all the Protosses are depleted with their builds versus Zergs, so to beat Solar I have to come up with something abnormal. So looking back all the strategies that were prevalent in the past days of SC2, I was able to come up with some new ones.

You've been having a good time recently, and I think it's gonna be acting as a great confidence boost for you, how do you feel?

I think in terms of my PvZ I think I gain some confidence, however I think once other Zergs adapt to my style, I'm not entirely sure what's gonna happen, so I need also to make adjustments as well.

You put up great fight versus Classic as well, especially in your skirmish skills, how do you feel? It's must be a little bit regrettable.

I believe I had the opportunities in both matches, however I think PvP in offline tournaments, very arduous and requires a lot of micro slash and macro management, so I think I need to compensate that a little bit better.

When you denied the plus-two weapons attack from Classic and who got yours done, what do you think about? Maybe you should've waited out little bit later in New Repugnancy?

No, when the prism was placed into harass, I didn't exactly evaluate how much damage I gave and took, so I think that's something I also need to work on for my future.

Well eventually you were able to flourish tonight, and it's been a while you've been in the round of 16, how do you think about group nomination?

I'm very content to make it to the round of 16. Although I'me not aware of how the groups will be formed out, however if I prepared well enough then I think regardless of how the groups were formed out I think I can do well.

All right, your expectations and goals for this season?

Absolutely winning this tournament is my ultimate goal, and I will try to prepare as much as possible, even if I don't make it all the way, I still want to make it to the quarterfinals. Thank you!
