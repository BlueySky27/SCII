### GSL2019S2 32强D组 赛后采访

Dear

Here's your winner for group D, Newbee.Dear, congratulations!

Thank you!

You are the nemesis of soo, and your proved it once again today, how do you feel about finishing first today?

The first game was PvP, I thought it's gonna be arduous because of my PvP skills. Despite the fact that I made a lot of mistakes I was feeling great because that I won. For the winner's match I played as placid as possible, because it was soo whom I always won against, so that was it.

These days Protosses are usually playing timing attack versus Zerg in the current state of meta, is that what it is?

If Zergs try to play very greedily, we have to kill them at a certain timing, otherwise the game just gets completely out of control. So I reallydidn't scout very much on what soo does, I just focused on my base, and I think that worked out very well in my favor.

You weren't able to showcase your PvT, which is a very potent one. And you might be very regrettable that your streak to the fact that your streak got caught off to Maru in last season. How do you feel?

A lot of people were telling me that your PvT is great, and I felt a lot of pressure. However I never cared about streak too much and also I lost because Maru played very well as well. And since Maru‘s being eliminated this season, I think I can overcome any other Terrans that I encounter in the future.

So now that some of your nemesises such as Maru and Zest are already eliminated, what is your confidence level in this season thus far?

I'm practicing very hard incessantly, and now that there are no nemesises of mine thus far in this season, so I think I can go at least make it to the semifinals.

Classic is the current top-seed, what do you think about him being the top-seed for the upcoming group nomination?

He and I have been practicing frequently and we've been sharing a lot of strategies, so I don't think he's gonna pick me. I think he's gonna use his draft to his favor.

All right, any last words to the fans?

Passing the round of 32 with ease, I'm very happy about it. I hope to do well again in the following round of 16. Thank you very mush!

All right, here is your runner-up for group D, soO, from Chivo.

Thank you.

You finally make it to the round of 16 in this season, how do you feel?

I didn't expect to advance, howeve I'm happy that I advanced and I think I was lucky.

After winning IEM Katowice, you lost in the round of 16 in season 1.

It doesn't really matter whether it's in the round of 32 or 16.

Must been very content.

I was very satiefied about winning IEM Katowice, so I didn't prepare too much and now reflecting that I try to redeem myself from it.

A lot of people are expecting, and whenever you appear to the freecup studio, we were able to see your portrait on the subway station. You haven't given up, right?

I never gave up, I keep practicing.

The current meta in PvZ is very all-in based builds by Protosses, however you actually started off as an all-in build. How do you think about the current state-of-the-art of PvZ.

Whenever I practiced PvZ, out of 10 games I probably win, like, maximum 2 games, so my confidence level is on the (), and I just try to gave some variability in terms of my builds, however I just got fended off too easily, so, you know, stupid me.

Are the Protosses' all-in timings too potent to be fended off?

From back in the days, I always knew Protoss is imba, and nobody ever accepted that fact, and I think the imbaness of Protoss has been released recently.

Even for such a high top-tier player like soO, the racial imbalance may be catching up. You weren't able to overcome your nemesis, Dear, how do you feel about it?

I never intended to overcome him, I would rather have him encountered someone else and just get knocked out of the tournament.

Regardless of a lot of your fans will be yearning for your GSL run as a champion, any words to your fans?

For a while I have been very lazy, and I haven't been preparing well. After watching Classic, you know, I was able to gain that mind that I can do that as well. I think he reunited my passion, so personally I want to thank him.

Now that he's the top-seed player.

I hope he uses it in a great method.

Congratulations once again!
