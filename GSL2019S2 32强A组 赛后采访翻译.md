### GSL2019S2 32强A组 赛后采访

Patience：

All right, a big upset has come on the opening game of season 2 of GSL code S. Congratulations, Patience.

Thank you.

You were able to defeat two of the strongest Terrans in current scene, how do you feel finishing first in your group?

I prepare well, I was confident so I knew I was gonna do well today.

Did you have sufficient confidence to beat the defending champion?

Initailly, I know a lot about INnoVation's styles, I knew what to prepare against him. I thought the match versus Maru would be very arduous, however I watch a lot of his past games and I try to come up with a lot of counter stratergies as much as possible for each map.

You were probably one of the most difficult opponents for Classic in the super tournament, you probably felt regrettable by not making it all the way to the super tournament.

Yes indeed I did, however because of my numerous mistakes during the series, so it is a very regrettable tournament for me, so I need to do well this season.

Despite Maru start with a bunker in the natural, you were able to break through.

Once I kill the reaper, I knew I had the opportunity to go a frontier force attack on his natural, so I think that was the biggest factor, take out the reaper.

You use a lot of resonating glaives, did you come up with that for your game plan today?

Initially I was only going to use that against Maru, however I need to beat INnoVation first in order to go to the winner's match so I just use a lot of this and that including the resonating glaives for adepts.

You know there were time when your frontier attack would be fended off if the siege tank on the high ground didn't come down, what do you feel about that?

Yes I believe that was true because of the fast construction of bunker, however thanks to him, he brought the siege tank to the low ground, so I was able to force through it.

You were evaluated as one of the high potential players yet you were very inconsistent throughout your career, what kind of efforts have you put in to break that inconsistency.

In the past if I practiced very hard quantitatively, then I would do well in tournament. These days there's more mental/image training so I just gave a lot of profound thoughts about what I'm gonna do on match days, so that's I think the biggest drive and force towards success.

You were the first pick on the drafts for the group nomination, what do you think about it?

I was a little bit offended to that, however if I get picked first again then, I make sure that I prepare the best of my ability and pick some buts.

Any last words to your fans?

I felt very great for being the first one making to the next round, and I hope I draft a great group and advance to the upper rounds. Thank you.



INnoVation:

All right, the one who stop Maru's streak. INnoVation, congratulations!

Thank you.

You finally put a halt on to Maru's incessant run in GSL, how do you feel about doing that and also making to the next round.

Maru was a very great player, I never had any thoughts of beating him, I think I just got luck tonight.

You are winning in a head-to-head match versus Maru, however playing versus a defending champion would be a nervous situation for you.

As I metioned Maru is a great player, I thought both Maru and I would advance from the round of 32, however, unlike my expectations Patience played very well.

It may be regreattable that you have been defeated by a Protoss today, is TvP a very hard match-up at this stage of the game.

In 2019 almost all of my matches that I lost were from Protosses, I think while mutiple skirmishes occur, I just can't follow them the mini map consistently enough. Furthermore I think Protoss is just good in offline tournament matches.

Have you been consistently researching mech in TvP?

No while I was working on it back in the lab, I like it very much, however I think I made a lot of mistakes today.

What happened on Automaton where you unloaded your siege tank onto the low ground.

I think a lot of people were saying that if I didn't unload it low ground then I would have won, but I think otherwise.

Last season you finished in RO16 and also followed by not qualifying for the super tournament. Must have been a very unfortunate and regrettable for you. What can we expect from it.

I know a lot of people expect a lot from me, however all I want to do this round right now is take a rest.

Must have practiceed very hard?

Not much, I just only prepare for TvP prior to today.

Any last words to your fans?

I don't think anyone predicted by victory versus Maru, still shaking due to this reality. Last year I always finished in the second group stage, so I hope to prepare well and do well and advance to the upper rounds this season.
