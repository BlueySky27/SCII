### GSL2019 超级赛1 RO8 赛后访谈

GuMiho 3 - 0 Stats

Seven Protoss from the quarterfinal, you are the only surviving Terran who's made it to the semifinals, congratulations!

Thank you.

What a clean sweap victory, can you please talk about your victory today?

I thought today would be a difficult match, however I won with ease, so I'm great. Despite the fact that I have to face more Protoss, I think I save 2 more builds, so I feel great on that regrad.

You know you showcase both your bio and mech in today's game, is your mech on the level of completion.

I think if mech is frequently used then it is a bad strategy. So I used to tell others that mech is very bad in TvP. However, if you pull it out once in a while, then it is a very viable strategy.

Banshee with speed upgrade seems very efficient, what is your opinion on it?

I think when the Protoss takes the third Nexus, that's probably the most uncomfortable timing for Terrans, so I considered using Banshees with speed upgrade to harrass that timing and I think it worked out pretty well today.

You know with all these Protoss remaining, all you care about is TvP. How do you feel about your current TvP?

I don't think it's that great for Terran. However due to the upgrade nerfs for the Infantry, I think it is still viable. 

But you're the only one who survives. 

In order to win in TvP, you have to win in the build order fight, because it's really difficult to make a combat once you are behind, especially against the Protoss. So it is important for you to win the build order fight.

You are the hope of Terran at this super tournament, can you dispose of the regret being knocked out early in S1.  Can you tell us your expectations moving forward?

I think I have a great chance and I will work hard as much as possible, since I took out Stats, one of the contenders for this super tournament.

 Thank you.



Parting 3 - 0 Hurricane

Alright, here is our second semifinalist, with another clean sweap of 3-neil, Parting, congratulations.

How long has it been since you are conducting an interview with me?

I really earn to talk with you on stage, and I think I lost a lot of opportunities and I was very angry to myself and I was very regrettful about me missing out those opportunities, so I am very contend to be here again.

You are one of the main players to make that plus-two weapon attack timing attack, what were some of your most regrettful moments?

For two years I have been on a hiatus from Starcraft 2, and when I missionary retired, my skill level was very high. Once I came back, I was doubting myself of whether I can do well again as I used to do back in the base. The online and offline environments are very different, so it's feeling nervous not performing well offline. And a lot of expectation are on the top of my shoulder because of my fans who watch my stream. And some of them make question like "is that really Parting?". So every match I lose, the pressure just incremented higher and higher.

You know, that's Parting.

I should be talking well, so I am a big talker.

A lot of people may be content with you having an interview with me here. You didn't even play robo-based build, that you were talking about back in dressing room, is that one of also your big picture drawing as well?

No, I just played like I played at laddar at home today. So I just try to do the minimum preparation and just make sure mentally trainning myself not to be nervous and not to feel the pressure. So I think unlike first day, today I wasn't feeling pressure at all, so I think that's why I was able to win with a clean sweap.

Now you'll have to play against GuMiho in the semifinal, we are very curious about you PvT, how is it thus far?

Throughout the qualifiers I have been singing that I want to meet Terrans.

You took out INnoVation, right?

I was just lucky in the qualifiers, and I think he was very complacent after he won WESG, so I think he just got a treat by me in the qualifiers. There are some of the builds that haven't been revealed to the world yet, so make sure I'm going to delineate those and move on to the finals.

We would like to see your ceremony again. Any last words to the fans?

I really didn't expect that I was going to reach to the semifinals. I'm not the Parting I used to be, I have practiced with the passion I used to have in the past as well. I thought I didn't deserve to be in the semis, however it's reminiscent once I reach the semifinals of my past. And in order not to be sorry for the players I took out, I'm just going to practice my but off and lift the championship trophy and take the title home.

Once again congratulations on your victory.



sOs 3 - 2 Zest

After gluing on PvP(此处存疑) ,we have our winner for our third quaterfinals, sOs, congratulations.

First of all, can you talk about your victory today?

You know these days in PvP, the meta is based on all-ins from one base, so I was mostly comtemplating how I should play today. I think everything was comfortable throughout the series, so that's how I played it up.

You know there were a lot of proxies throughout this super tournament in PvPs, is this gonna be the new state-of-the-art?

Blizzard made the game this way, so we're just gonna play as how it is.

And now is a very fun final match on Prot Alxander, that hidden expansion was very shocking. Prior to that in your other matches, you lost your dark shirne, however you were able to come back with your adepts, were some of your ways to get around with some of these setbacks throughout the game.

No, I was just too comfortable, because I didn't prepare anything coming into this match today. So I think that mental comfort allow me to combat in different types of situations.

So now for semifinal you have to play either versus Patience or Classic.  So we have Classic who won the last super tournament and as also on the above GSL who beat you both times. DO you want to face him again?

It's fine but I don't really prefer to meet him. Although he is a target of vegence, but I don't really want to seek vegence on the fellow of Protoss players. Patience plays like a purple(?) as well, it's very unorthodox.

Don't you think you're a purple(?) as well?

No I play very orthodox in standard.

A lot of people are expecting whether you can win the whole thing or not, any more to the fans?

Throughout this super tournament, I think I regain fun in playing Starcraft 2, so I am just gonna play as fun as possible, and hopefully I take it home.

Thank you.



Classic 3 - 2 Patience

Here is our last semifinalist, Classic, congratulations.

Thank you.

After your victory was determined, you seemed very relieved rather than being celebratory. How do you feel right now?

No, both in matches four and five, I think I lost both games, so I knew I had an uphill to climb, however, I felt great that I made a come back and won the game.

You play the series with a lot of difficulties today, however you were able to come back from a lot of deficient situations. What kind of score do you want to give to yourself in terms of your overall management skills?

I think my late game was pretty good, however, because of the opponent's unorthodox style, I think I got caught off with it too much, so I cannot give a good grade on that one.

Patience is known for a lot of his unconvetional builds as well as a lot of flashy plays. Was that something that you had a hard time to deal with?

Yeah, he is a very great PvP player, so today's game went very difficult and () over all.

You are successful in terms of making a combat, and now you are on your way to the semifinals and for another opportunity to take the title home. Now you have to play versus sOs, what kind of games do you expect?

I mentioned that Patience is already unconventional, however sOs even more bizarre, he' doing some like hidden expansion thing staff, so I think tomorrow's gonna be more arduous, and there will be a lot of mind games and brain fights among two of us.

No I think that's one of the biggest blownies in 2019, that he's saying he is a standard player and he's one of the most convetional ones. I have to figure out plans to take his plans apart.

I think the semifinals will be very amusing, so before we wrap up, any words to the fans?

A lot of people have this perception that PvP is very boring, however when I play with sOs we make a lot of great game, so I hope all of you have some expectations going forward and I will do my best to win the title again.

Thank you.
