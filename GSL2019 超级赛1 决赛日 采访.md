### GSL2019 超级赛1 决赛日 采访

Gumiho 3 - 1 Parting

赛前：

Since the WIngs of Liberty, these two are the veterans of variance, and they finally count down the semifinals. We have GuMiho and Parting. First off with GuMiho, it's been a very long time since you took top-4 in an offline tournament, how do you feel about it?

No I think I am gonna win for sure because I took out Stats yesterday in the quaterfinals. I belive Stats is a much stronger opponent that Parting is, so I think today is gonna be much easier than what it was yesterday.

Alright, how do you think about it, Parting?

First of all, I never thought that GuMiho will be able to defeat Stats, I think it actually affected greatly for me, because I had to prepare a lot more. I'm just gonna make him regret what he just said and showcase great games.

You are yearning for Terrans for recent times, and your PvT had been stellar back in the days, defeating Maru multiple times. And GuMiho, since Parting metioned about him releasing all the PvT builds, what do you think about it.

Don't even think about using any builds, because I am gonna come after you with some of mine.

What do you think about this commence, Parting?

I think he's just being hilarious, I'll think he's being GuMiho himself. There is an old saying, "You never know until you get hit by it." So I'll make sure I'm gonna beat hell out of it.

These two are showcasing a very high confidence, GuMiho showcase first utility in both using Bio and Mech to take out Stats, which one do you fear more?

I've know GuMiho since the Wings of Liberty days, and he's being using mech things all the times. So I knew he's gonna use it at least once, however, the state of his builds was very near-perfect, so I hope he use mech again cause I know how to counter those.

It's gonna be very curious and interesting how the games gonna be hand out. Before we commence the matches, any lsst words to your opponents.First off with GuMiho.

I'm playing against Parting in a very long time in offline tournaments. I had a nightmare back in the days, I think it was in dream. Make sure I'm going to give a great payback to him.

Everyone has dreams, however dreams don't become successful that easily. So make sure I bear a hell out of it and just gonna lift the trophy. That's all I'm thinking about at this point.



Classic 3 - 1 sOs

赛前：

GuMiho wins 3-1, he has secured his spot. In the GSL super tournament semifinal now we're gonna have a PvP, to see who's gonna advance and face him. At first, we have sOs. Whenever you encounter Classic, you was that close but you always fell short. Was the preparation bit arduous?

Whenever I meet Classic, I always fell short. So it doesn't really matter whether you lose in a close fight or you lost in a landslide, loss to loss. So recently I try to keep my mind placid and try to enjoy the games and I have been having a lot of fun, so that's what I'm gonna do today as well.

Now you are encountering sOs to fight for the last spot on the finals. He's probably one of the more difficult opponents, what do you think about sOs?

I really don't want to encounter sOs because he has a lot of versatility. So it's gonna be a grueling match today.

A lot of fans in the community are talking about sOs saying "I am the most conventional Protoss here". What do you think about that phenomenon in the past 24 hours?

I think I deserve to hear such words from Classic, and I believe that I have my own conventional standards, so that's why I believe I am the most conventional Protoss out here.

On the interview yesterday, you have benchmarked a lot of unorthodox styles such as the hidden expansions of sOs. Prior to the match, do you want to say anything to him?

No sOs just plays without his mind, and therefore that's why he's showcasing those bizarre gameplays. He's always being a fun-based player, so I need to tighten myself up and play as hard as I can.

Today I think there will be a lot of expectation that there will be great series. sOs, any words to Classic?

Classic, I hope you really win, cause this is your final here. I hope you win this super tournament and S2 and S3 consecutively, cause this is your last year. So just take it.

Any words back, Classic?

That's just his saying. Once we get into the games, he's just gonna clash my mentality by using some of the most bizarre staff ever. So I'm just not gonna get a () about it and just gonna keep my composure and win tonight.
