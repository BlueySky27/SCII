### GSL2019 S2 32强E组

Stats

The group of that, and we have Stats making out of it, congratulations!

Thank you.

At last we have round of 16 without you last season, how does it feel to come back?

First of all, last season I dropped out from the round of 32, I was thinking that what if I drop once again, I have a lot of worries like that, and because of that I practiced a lot harder, and my fingers actually hurt because I practice so much, and I think that is one of the reasons why I am able to make it out of the groups now.

And now you are full of schedules and practices, and was that actually fitting to your schedule?

Well, dropping out of GSL, I actually used to analyze and watch all the matches, but dropping out of round of 32, then I actually did not tune into GSL after the moment for a while. And GSL without me didn't feel the same, so it's kind of awkard.

Yeah, but your match say it was really good, and fantasy, it seemed like he had something prepared specifically against you. And losing the first set but taking the set two and three what did you have in plan in the winners match?

So I didn't actually prepare too much about PvT, a lot more for PvZ, and then the games actually went nicely for me, and then I was trying to adapt to the opponent whatever he did, until fantasy turn up the strategy, I think he actually got me, especially the first one, but I got a lot of his units, and I think I was able to win the games.

You had the timing rush based in Immortals, and there was ling drops, the timings, and what if you were able to focus without the ling drops, without the harassment from the others side, you think it was still possible?

Leenock has a lot of zerglings focused troops, and there are some combinations with roaches often times, but he was actually focusing on lings too much, so I think that was the reason why I was able to break through the Immortals.

Leenock was also talking about he had some late gas, and this timing rush with Immortals was really strong tight now, and there are lot of Zergs that are not being able to defend against it, you think there is a really good players that can go against the startegy?

I had a lot of mind games, but I was able to break through often times, so I can't really pick one. I think Zergs are trying to get used to this timing against the Immortal rush, showing a lot of robotics, and I think when Zergs are used to that kind of play, as long as you know how to adapt and defend what's coming, you get a lot of better, but right now the reason why it's strong I think it's because the Zerg player don't know exactly how to defend against it, but when they do I think they will be strong again.

And it's being a while, and you are going to be in it with Classic of course he's being waiting, how do you think the group nominations gonna go?

Yeah whenever I went up, I was one of the seeds, but I'm not in that place anymore, so it's a weird feeling right now, but whatever happens in the group nominations, I do want go into the group of lot of Terrans, but I don't know if it's going to happen.

Of course any words to the fans?

A lot of fans at the venue are cheering for me, and there a lot o friends who help me practice all the way, Solar, Ragnarok, and TY, there a lot of players who help me out, and I do want to say thanks to all of them.

Seems you have a lot of friends.

I don't really go out of my house, and I just stay at my house, playing games. (Artosis: I feel you, Stats.) But when I come to the venue and meet all the players, they are the best friends that I have.(Artosis: It's been very silly you Stats, Tasteless: Wow very well.) And Dear actually help me a lot during the practice, so I want to say special thanks to Dear. And Zest also helped me a lot, and we had a lot of fun memories in Blizzcon last year. And if he does better in season 3 maybe we can go all together in season 3.

Congrats again, Stats, and back to the nerds.

(Tasteless: How dare you, you think we are nerds, huh? Because we cast computer games tournaments?)



FanTaSy

Since the round of 16 from S2 of 2015, and he went to military service and he came back, we have fantasy going to the round of 16, congratulations!

Thank you.

Like what I just said, it's been some time for you to advance to the round of 16, how did it feel?

At first I thought I had a lot of practice to be done, but the final game, of course, I was actually losing in a lot of moments, that I thought"This was it, this was it!" for the moment, but I keep playing the game and I came back, and by having this hard game it makes me feel so much better going into the round of 16.

It seemed like all the preparation, it seem like you took some time perfecting your form.

It took me some time at the beginning of today, I actually have some weird moments of the game, but also Leenock, I think he also had some weird moments of the game too. So the one who came better from the moments, I think was able to win.

I think it's great that you came back here and actually advance, was it really hard and tough to have all that practice to come up to the stage now.

Yeah it's really hard to practice all the amount, but just having this kind of results I think all this waves out the stress I have before, and from this moment I know I can be better.

You think you are up to the final four? You are perfection of form, how far do you think you can make it here?

I think the group I had today is about as hard as what I'm gonna get at the round of 16, if practice really hard I think I could do it once again in the round of 16.

In your lot of TvZ games, of course you have a lot of bio for the few, but your mech build seem to be working a lot better against Zerg, which do you think is the better one?

Depending on the situation, I think I'd switch in the middle, and I think I had to try really hard to find that moment.

And of course you have quick battle cruiser build in one of your games, how do you come up with that, two starports?

For few days I've been thinking all day long, what strategy should I do, what build should I do? And there was some time that I was thinking about, and I think I just had the right moment and I just used the strategy, and it just came out all right. I'm still learning, I'm still watching a lot of the matches.

Yes, FanTaSy says he's still learning. And of course moving to the next set of matches, where do you see yourself heading to, your goal for the season?

I actually want to go to the round of 8, and once I go to round of 8, I think I'm really good at preparing against specific player, I think that's my first goal. And I think if I passed that moment I think I could climb up higher, even all the way to the championship spot, I think it's possible.

Of course you have a lot of your fans in the venue, and final words to the fans?

There are lots of friends and people who I actually know at the venue, and also my friends from the military came down to the venue too, and I think also that's part of the reason why I was able to win today, and I wish you guys come back at the next match too.

That's great for having so many friends. Congratulations again. And back to Artosis and Tasteless.

But mostly Tasteless.
